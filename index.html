  <p> Just a lil project to inspire myself and others to learn code :) HTML is easy to learn and could let you learn some skills before you learn advanced code.
    <br> Heres an example:<br/> 
</p> 
<img class="Example1" src="Example1.png" alt="Example of some html code">
<br> <br/>


<script src="https://static.app/js/static.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

<p>This is an "img" link that my cursor is on.
  adding an image to HTML Isn't really that difficult, just requires a little bit of coding knowledge! Here im going to give another example.
</p>
<img src="Example2.png" alt="An example of img">
<br> <br/>
<br> <br/>
<br> <br/> 
<br> <br/>
<br> <br/>
<br> <br/>
<br> <br/>

<p>Here is the properties of an img line. As you can see the &quotborder-style&quot is set to lined. Heres an HTML editor hyperlink  so you can practice too! 
</p>
<br> Made using <a href="https://studio.code.org/projects/weblab/XCU72wuBn74bLpB9mTRC-ka5GRQrwNn1AohwaYZ1dlg/edit">Codestudio HTML editor</a> 
<br/>
and <a href="https://code.org/educate/weblab">HTML Lab Learn</a>

<p> Alright on to the next thing. . . 
</p>
<br> </br>
<p class="Test1"> Now im going to talk about classes. This red box apart from the other text represents it. And within this box is a class by itself that can be assigned to any code on HTML  
</p>
<p>
<img class="ImgTest" src="Test1.1.png">
</p>
<img class="ImgTest" src="Test1.png">
<p> 
As you can see you can assign a class to just the &quotp&quot class, simple right?</p>
<br> </br>
<br> </br>
<h2>
  <a id="hyperlink" href="https://controlc.com/c6e09c6d">Unblocked Games</a>
  <p id="hyperlink">bc522667!</p>
</h2>

<p id="pID"> Now along with classes we have &quotIDs&quot something as useful as classes themselves. Heres an example</p>

<img id="screenshot1" src="Screenshot-2023-11-16-1.57.17-PM.png" alt="screenshot"> <img id="screenshot1" src="Screenshot-2023-11-16-1.57.23-PM.png"> 

<p> As you see I put an &quotID&quot tag right after the &quotp&quot line a simple use of an ID tag.
  <br> </br>
<br> </br>
</p>
<br> </br>
<br> </br>
<p> I learned that you can add a shawdow to a box lol. You can assign colors to it too!
  <img id="notes1" src="notes.png">
  <img id="notes2" src="box-shadow.png">
  
</p>
<br> </br> <p> Soon I will add more pages for different subjects
</p>

<p>  I love my aunt kansas
